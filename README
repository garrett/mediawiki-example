This repository is designed to be used with http://openshift.redhat.com/

Quickstart
==========

1) Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/
2) Create a php-5.3 application and attach mysql to it:
    $ rhc app create -a mediawiki -t php-5.3
    $ rhc app cartridge add -a mediawiki -c mysql-5.1
3) Add this upstream mediawiki repo
    $ cd mediawiki
    $ git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift/mediawiki-example.git
    $ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
4) Then push the repo upstream
    $ git push
5) That's it, you can now checkout your application at:
    http://mediawiki-$yourlogin.rhcloud.com
6) Default Admin Username: Admin
   Default Password: OpenShiftAdmin

Updates
=======

In order to update or upgrade to the latest mediawiki, you'll need to re-pull
and re-push.

1) Pull from upstream:
    $ cd mediawiki/
    $ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
2) Push the new changes upstream
    $ git push
3) Update MediaWiki to the new version by visiting
  http://mediawiki-$yourlogin.rhcloud.com/mw-config/
  or by running `php update.php` in the maintenance directory on your server.


Repo layout
===========
php/ - Externally exposed php code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For not-externally exposed php code
../data - For persistent data
deplist.txt - list of pears to install
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every push, just prior to
    starting your app


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave php, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


deplist.txt
===========

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when
the user git pushes.
